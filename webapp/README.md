This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## How to run front-end:
- From the root of the repository navigate to 'webapp' directory (`cd webapp`)
- Install node modules by running: `npm install`
- Start react application by running: `npm start`
- In `Constants.ts` file you can find back-end base url that react will use. If your backend is running on different URL, please update the constant.
